<p>The aim of this GSoC project is to provide a convenient way to access documentation in the Juno IDE. Any work on this has to be on the Julia side &#40;for getting the necessary information by introspection&#41; <em>and</em> on the Atom side &#40;for presenting said information&#41;.</p>
<p>Most of the work on the Julia side went into a new package, <a href="https://github.com/pfitzseb/DocSeeker.jl">DocSeeker.jl</a>, which implements all of the introspection necessary to get docstrings from installed packages; a small shim in Atom.jl &#40;<a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/Atom.jl/pull/99">Atom.jl#99</a>&#41; then delegates any front end requests to that package.</p>
<p>The front end work is directly included in the Juno stack &#40;<a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client/pull/377">atom-julia-client#377</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/pull/148">atom-ink#148</a>, to be precise&#41;, since it&#39;s pretty fundamental IDE functionality.</p>
<h2 id="backend_docseekerjl"><a href="/pub/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno.html#backend_docseekerjl">Backend: DocSeeker.jl</a></h2>  The two main challenges here are <em>collecting docstrings</em> and <em>filtering docstrings</em>, both in the most performant and reliable manner possible.</p>
<h3 id="collecting_information"><a href="/pub/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno.html#collecting_information">Collecting Information</a></h3>  DocSeeker.jl contains a function <code>alldocs&#40;&#41;</code>, which will return information about all symbols available in the current Julia session. Those symbols are easily found by recursing through all currently loaded <code>Module</code>s and calling <code>Base.names&#40;&#41;</code> on them. Additionally, Julia&#39;s docsystem collects all symbols with attached docstrings, which can be easily retrieved.</p>
<p>All of that is pretty slow â€“ it takes on the order of half a second on my machine with a couple of loaded packages &#40;and returns information about ~13,000 symbols&#41;. At the same time the available symbols don&#39;t change too often, so caching is a viable solution.</p>
<h3 id="filtering"><a href="/pub/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno.html#filtering">Filtering</a></h3>  There are all sorts of possible options to consider when filtering and searching through the symbols &#40;and attached docstrings&#41; returned by <code>alldocs</code>, but I&#39;ve decided on a few that turned out to be most important while testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exported: Julia doesn&#39;t &#40;yet&#41; have a way to make certain symbols part of a module&#39;s public API, so I&#39;m using the set of exported symbols instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Module: It&#39;s possible to search in a specified module, in all loaded modules or in all installed modules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Search: Either in names only, or in names and docstrings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point warrants some more information, because it&#39;s not as trivial as the other two to get at least somewhat right. The basic problem here is a &#40;fuzzy&#41; full text search, which is what each search engine out there in the depth of the internet tries to do. Naturally there are quite a few &#40;open source&#41; implementations out there already: solr, lunr &#40;which is used by <a href="https://docs.julialang.org">docs.julialang.org</a>&#41;, but also e.g. the FTS extension for SQL and many more.</p>
<p>In the early days of the summer I was trying a couple of things to get this to work properly, but shelling out to Java or JavaScript seemed like overkill for the problem at hand, while SQL.jl was giving me quite a hard time <em>and</em> doesn&#39;t ship the FTS extension by default.</p>
<p>A custom implementation did not seem too hard at first, but requires a <em>good</em> scoring function that, given a search query <code>needle</code>, maps a docstring to a number between 0 and 1:</p>
\[ score: (needle, \, docstr) \mapsto [0, 1] \]
<p>At first I tried rolling my own string comparison function &#40;with mixed success&#41;, but then I stumbled upon the excellent <a href="https://github.com/matthieugomez/StringDistances.jl">StringDistances.jl</a> which does pretty much all I needed.</p>
<p>The scoring function is applied to all relevant symbols in a threaded loop &#40;which gives a free 1.5x speedup on my machine&#41;; afterwards all applicable filters are applied and the top 20 results are returned.</p>
<p>Filtering and searching takes about 0.1s on my machine, which means that it&#39;s almost negligible compared to the time necessary for retrieving the docstrings.</p>
<h2 id="frontend"><a href="/pub/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno.html#frontend">Frontend</a></h2>  Now that DocSeeker.jl has found the results we asked for, it&#39;s time to display them in an appealing manner: <img src="/assets/images/blog/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno/search.png" alt="search" /></p>
<p>If you&#39;ve used Juno before you may notice the much improved markdown rendering &#40;which is of course available all throughout Juno&#41;: There&#39;s syntax highlighting, LaTeX rendering and lots of general improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that the docpane UI shows most relevant information &#40;type of the binding, defining module, whether the binding is exported etc.&#41;; a click on the binding will take you to the defining location and a click on the module will give some information on that. Links also generally work fine &#40;external ones will open in your default browser, while those defined with Documenter.jl&#39;s <code>&#91;link&#93;&#40;@ref&#41;</code> syntax will start a new search&#41;.</p>
<h2 id="try_it"><a href="/pub/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno.html#try_it">Try it&#33;</a></h2>  These features will have been integrated into Juno at the beginning of September 2017, so feel free to try them&#33;</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements"><a href="/pub/2017-08-28-gsoc-docs-in-juno.html#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2>  I&#39;d like to thank Mike Innes for all the fruitful discussions about implementation and functionality, as well as his guidance on Julia/Juno development in general &#40;well before GSoC even started&#41;.
