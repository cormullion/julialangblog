<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Julia Language is taking part in this year’s <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>. This means that interested students will have the opportunity to spend their summers getting paid to write code on a project of their choice.</p>
<p>Student applications are open from <strong>March 14th – 25th</strong> on the SoC website, but there’s no reason not to get going right away&#33; To get you started thinking about what you’d like to work on, there are a bunch of interesting projects on our <a href="http://julialang.org/soc/ideas-page.html">ideas page</a>. At this stage, it’s also a good idea to start getting involved with the community around your area of interest by opening issues, sending PRs and speaking to developers on relevant packages. Finding a good mentor for your project will be a big help for most applications, and showing mentors your enthusiasm is a great way to get them on board. Once you’re ready to start writing an application, check out our <a href="http://julialang.org/soc/guidelines/">guidelines</a> which gives some hints on what to include.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the kind of projects we&#39;d like to support:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Parallel and distributed computing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for data science and analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compiler optimisations and work on Julia on Android</p>
</li>
<li><p>Numerical and scientific computing – ODEs, matrix library functions, optimisation…</p>
</li>
<li><p>IDEs, tooling and 2D/3D visualisation</p>
</li>
<li><p>GPUs for graphics and numerical computing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Web tooling and networking</p>
</li>
<li><p>… and much more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome involvement in our summer frivolities even if you’re not a student. Firstly, if you happen to know any students, please let them know&#33; We’d also like to encourage people to step up as mentors, so if you’re interested then please contact us &#40;see below&#41; and let us know what areas you’d like to help with. Please also feel free to give technical feedback on proposals that come up on our mailing lists.</p>
<p>The primary point of contact for the community is our mailing list, julia-users@googlegroups.com. For more administrative questions you can also reach out to us privately at juliasoc@googlegroups.com. Feel free to start discussions about projects and ideas, although note that it’s easier for us to answer broad questions about the process than to give specific technical feedback.</p>
<p>Our participation in previous years has resulted in some great projects, so we’re really looking forward to working with you this year and seeing what you can do. Good luck&#33;</p>
