# The official Julia blog, mirrored using the Franklin.jl package

See it [in action](https://julialangblogmirror.netlify.com/).

This repository contains copies of the Markdown source files and accompanying images from the offical [Julia](https://julialang.org/blog/) blog, the originals are maintained by the Julia team [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/tree/master/blog).

The official blog uses Hugo (written in Go). This mirror uses Thibaut Lienart's [Franklin](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), an all-Julia static site generator instead, for the purpose of exploring and demonstrating some of its many features.

Some changes have been made to the Markdown formatting of the original posts to accommodate the differences between Jekyll-flavoured Markdown and Julia-flavoured Markdown (which are both close approximations to the "official" Markdown standard). Some Jekyll-specific additions have been removed or replaced with equivalents where possible.
