# README

This is a mirror of the Julia Programming Language's main website, [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/).

The repository for the source code of the language itself can be found at [github.com/JuliaLang/julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

The Julia website is generated using GitHub pages and [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), a Julia native package for building websites.
