# README

This is the GitHub repository for the Julia Programming Language's main website, [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/).
The repository for the source code of the language itself can be found at [github.com/JuliaLang/julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

The Julia website is generated using GitHub pages and [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), a Julia native package for building websites.

## Making Simple Changes

To suggest a change to the website, you can simply navigate to the page with the content you think should be changed, and edit it.
You will be prompted to fork the repo (if you haven't already) and then open a Pull Request. Once the Pull Request is open, Netlify will build a preview of the site with the changes you made.
You can click the link there to validate that the changes appear as you would expect.

Once your Pull Request is merged, you should see your changes show up on the website in a few minutes or less.

## Making More Complex Changes

To suggest a change to the website that is more significant, it is suggested that you make said changes and test them locally on your device.
You can do this by simply forking the base repo, cloning it locally onto your device, making the changes you want, and then following the "Installing locally" instructions below.

Once you have validated that everything looks good, you can open a Pull Request and check the Deploy Preview from Netlify as a final sanity check.

## Making modifications and seeing the changes locally

Start by installing Franklin: in Julia,

```
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Franklin")
```

then, clone the repository, `cd` to  it and do

```
julia> using Franklin

julia> serve()
→ Initial full pass...
→ evaluating code [...] (learning/code-examples.md)
→ Starting the server...
✓ LiveServer listening on https://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000` in a browser and you should see a preview of any modifications you make locally.

**Modifying the CSS**: modify the relevant files in `_css/`.

**Modifying the HTML structure**: if you want to modify the navbar, or the footer, go to `_layout/` and modify the relevant template fragment.

**Modifying the landing page**: since the landing page has its own design, it is written in HTML with a few insertions of repurposeable fragments where appropriate, just modify `index.html`

## Looking for broken links

Every so often, one should do an in-depth check that there are no broken links.
While Franklin provides a quick way to do this, it's a good idea to this in depth from time to time.
The [broken-link-checker](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker) package is a pretty neat way to do this.
After installing it with `npm` just do

```
blc https://julialang.org -ro
```

(it takes a while, and may require you to do it in several steps).
