# Julia blog mirror via JuDoc

See it [in action](https://julialangblogmirror.netlify.com/).

Note: the pre-rendering processes almost all pages perfectly fine but complains about:

- 2 posts in chinese (though it's hard to say what's the issue but it may be a unicode thing)
- the post on `Graft.jl` though I couldn't find the issue.
